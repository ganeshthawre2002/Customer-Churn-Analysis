# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify patterns and potential causes of customer churn. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Customer Churn CSV file
- **Features Include:** `tenure`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Churn`, `SeniorCitizen`, and more.

## ❓ Key Business Questions
- What proportion of customers are churning?
